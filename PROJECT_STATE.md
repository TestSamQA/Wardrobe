# Wardrobe — Project State

> Last updated: 2026-03-22
> Phase completed: 5 of 6

## What This App Is

An AI-powered personal wardrobe and styling app. Self-hosted, mobile-first PWA. Core concept:
- Analyse the user's colour season (12-season system) from a photo or manual input
- Build a digital wardrobe by photographing clothing (AI extracts all metadata)
- Create outfits manually or with AI, saved with a flatlay composite image
- Chat with an AI stylist that knows your colour profile, style, and full wardrobe
- Chat with AI about individual wardrobe items ("would these work with shorts?")

## Build Phases

### Phase 1 — Infrastructure & Auth ✅ COMPLETE
Auth, database schema, image storage, app shell, Docker, PWA setup.

### Phase 2 — Onboarding ✅ COMPLETE (2026-03-21)
Colour season analysis (photo + manual), style archetype selection, StyleProfile saved, profile page.

### Phase 2 — Onboarding Flow ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** User completes colour season analysis and style selection → StyleProfile created.

Steps:
1. ✅ `POST /api/onboarding/analyze-photo` — upload selfie to MinIO, Claude Vision analysis, returns structured JSON
2. ✅ `POST /api/onboarding/complete` — upserts StyleProfile, sets onboardingStatus=COMPLETE
3. ✅ `components/onboarding/photo-upload-step.tsx` — camera/file input, blob preview, calls analyze-photo
4. ✅ `components/onboarding/color-season-result.tsx` — season card, palette swatches, AI reasoning, season override dropdown
5. ✅ `components/onboarding/manual-input-step.tsx` — undertone/depth/hair/eyes selectors → deterministic SEASON_MAP lookup
6. ✅ `components/onboarding/style-picker.tsx` — 2-column card grid of 8 archetypes
7. ✅ `app/(app)/onboarding/photo/page.tsx` — client-side wizard (upload → result → manual → style)
8. ✅ `app/(app)/profile/page.tsx` — season card, archetype, palette, skin/hair/eye details

### Phase 3 — Wardrobe ✅ COMPLETE (2026-03-21)
**Goal:** Users can upload clothes, AI extracts metadata, items are browseable.

Steps:
1. ✅ Claude prompt for item analysis → structured JSON (name, category, colors, colorHexes, pattern, material, formality, seasons, notes)
2. ✅ `POST /api/wardrobe` SSE — upload → sharp thumbnail → Claude Vision → save → stream 4 progress steps
3. ✅ `GET /api/wardrobe` with category/formality/q filters
4. ✅ `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/wardrobe/[itemId]` — soft delete via archivedAt
5. ✅ `components/wardrobe/item-upload-form.tsx` — SSE stream reader with step labels + done/error states
6. ✅ `components/wardrobe/item-card.tsx` — thumbnail, name, category, colour swatches
7. ✅ `components/wardrobe/item-grid.tsx` — 2-column grid + empty state
8. ✅ `components/wardrobe/filter-bar.tsx` — horizontally scrollable category chips (updates URL params)
9. ✅ `components/wardrobe/item-detail-actions.tsx` — editable user notes + delete with confirm
10. ✅ `/wardrobe` — server-rendered grid with filter + add button
11. ✅ `/wardrobe/add` — upload form page
12. ✅ `/wardrobe/[itemId]` — full image, all metadata, notes editor, delete

**Key decisions:**
- All `<Image>` components for MinIO-proxied images use `unoptimized` — next/image's optimizer makes server-to-server requests without a session cookie, which 401s against `/api/images`
- `FilterBar` uses `useSearchParams()` so requires a `<Suspense>` boundary in the server-rendered wardrobe page
- Seasons on wardrobe items are weather seasons (Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter), not colour seasons
- AI output is validated and sanitised before saving — invalid category/formality values fall back to safe defaults

**Phase 3 gotchas:**
- **EXIF rotation:** Mobile photos carry an EXIF orientation tag. sharp strips EXIF without applying the rotation, so images appeared rotated 90°. Fix: call `.rotate()` (no args) before any other sharp operation — this reads the EXIF orientation, bakes it into pixels, and strips the tag. Applied to both the full image and thumbnail. Full image is also re-encoded to JPEG so orientation is always normalised at rest.
- **LCP warning for above-fold images:** next/image defaults to `loading="lazy"` which triggers a console warning when the image is the LCP element. Fix: pass `priority={i < 2}` from `ItemGrid` to `ItemCard` so the first two grid items get `loading="eager"` + `fetchpriority="high"`.

### Phase 4 — Outfit Creator ✅ COMPLETE (2026-03-21)
**Goal:** Manual and AI outfit creation with flatlay composite images.

Steps:
1. ✅ `lib/flatlay-ai.ts` — two-step AI flatlay: Claude writes an art-direction prompt from item metadata, Replicate (Flux 1.1 Pro) renders a cohesive editorial flatlay image
2. ✅ `POST /api/outfits/generate` (SSE) — loads wardrobe + StyleProfile, sends to Claude, returns `{ itemIds, name, rationale }` with itemId validation
3. ✅ `POST /api/outfits` (SSE) — validates items, saves outfit to DB immediately, then generates AI flatlay; streams `saving → generating → done`. Outfit is accessible even if flatlay generation fails.
4. ✅ `GET /api/outfits` — list with `_count.items`
5. ✅ `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/outfits/[outfitId]` — soft delete via `archivedAt`
6. ✅ `components/outfits/outfit-builder.tsx` — client component: Manual tab (selectable item grid) + AI Suggest tab (SSE stream reader, pre-fills name + selected items from AI result)
7. ✅ `components/outfits/outfit-card.tsx`, `outfit-grid.tsx` — flatlay card grid with empty state
8. ✅ `components/outfits/outfit-detail-actions.tsx` — delete with confirm
9. ✅ `/outfits` — server-rendered grid + create button
10. ✅ `/outfits/create` — outfit builder page
11. ✅ `/outfits/[outfitId]` — flatlay, name, meta badges, AI rationale, items list (links to wardrobe items), delete

**Key decisions:**
- Flatlay stored in `BUCKET_IMAGES` under `{userId}/outfits/{outfitId}.jpg`
- `OutfitBuilder` fetches wardrobe items client-side from `/api/wardrobe` — avoids importing `lib/minio.ts` in a client component (MinIO client uses Node.js APIs)
- Client-side image URLs inlined as `/api/images/${bucket}/${key}` rather than importing `buildImageUrl` from `lib/minio.ts`
- Flatlay generation failure is non-fatal — outfit saves first, flatlay generates second; if Replicate fails the user is still redirected to the outfit detail page (just without an image)
- `POST /api/outfits` is SSE (same pattern as generate) so the 10–20s Replicate call doesn't block as a silent hang — client shows "Saving outfit…" → "Creating flatlay image…"
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` required in `.env`; uses `black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro`

**⚠️ Needs testing before Phase 5:**
- End-to-end flatlay generation: create an outfit, verify the SSE stream progresses through `saving → generating → done`, and that a real Flux image appears on the detail page
- Check image quality — if the Flux prompt needs tuning, adjust the Claude art-direction instructions in `lib/flatlay-ai.ts`
- Confirm `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` is set in `.env` and the account has credits

**Phase 4 gotchas:**
- **Login page `useSearchParams` build failure:** Adding Phase 4 routes pushed the build to prerender `/login`, which exposed a pre-existing missing Suspense boundary around `useSearchParams()`. Fixed by splitting `LoginPage` into a server component + `LoginForm` client component wrapped in `<Suspense>` (same pattern used for `FilterBar` in Phase 3).
- **No minio imports in client components:** `lib/minio.ts` instantiates a MinIO `Client` at module level using Node.js net/crypto — importing it in a client component would fail at runtime. `OutfitBuilder` constructs image URLs manually instead.

### Phase 5 — AI Chat ✅ COMPLETE (2026-03-22)
**Goal:** General wardrobe chat + per-item chat, both streaming with full context.

Steps:
1. ✅ `POST /api/chat` — SSE streaming, general stylist chat seeded with colour season + style archetype + full wardrobe
2. ✅ `POST /api/items/[itemId]/chat` — SSE streaming, item-focused system prompt with full item metadata
3. ✅ `components/chat/message-bubble.tsx` — user/assistant bubbles, markdown rendering via react-markdown + remark-gfm
4. ✅ `components/chat/chat-input.tsx` — auto-resizing textarea, Enter to send
5. ✅ `components/chat/chat-window.tsx` — SSE stream reader, session persistence, auto-scroll
6. ✅ `/chat` — full-screen general stylist chat, conversation persists across visits
7. ✅ `/wardrobe/[itemId]/chat` — full-screen per-item chat linked from item detail page

**Key decisions:**
- One persistent general chat session per user, one per-item session per user+item (find-or-create)
- `sessionId: null` from client omitted from request body to avoid Zod rejecting null (schema uses `optional()` not `nullable()`)
- Markdown rendered on assistant messages only — user messages stay plain text
- `anthropic.messages.stream()` returns `AsyncIterable<MessageStreamEvent>` — iterate and filter `content_block_delta` with `text_delta` (no `textStream` property in SDK 0.80)

### Phase 6 — Polish & PWA Hardening
- PWA icons (192px, 512px, maskable 512px) — need actual icon assets
- Error boundaries, loading skeletons on all pages
- Rate limiting on all Claude API routes
- Content-Security-Policy headers
- Mobile UI pass (44px tap targets, scroll behaviour)
- Verify "Add to Home Screen" on iOS and Android

---

## Phase 1: What Was Achieved

Everything in Phase 1 is complete and the production build passes clean.

**Working:**
- Next.js 16 project with TypeScript, Tailwind v4, App Router
- Full Prisma 7 schema with all models, relations, and indexes
- Auth.js magic-link email authentication (JWT sessions, onboarding status in token)
- MinIO image storage — upload route, auth-gated image proxy route
- Auth guard (`proxy.ts`) — redirects unauthenticated users to /login, redirects incomplete onboarding to /onboarding
- App shell — bottom nav (4 tabs), top bar component
- Login and verify pages
- All lib modules: prisma.ts, auth.ts, minio.ts, claude.ts, color-seasons.ts
- Docker Compose, Dockerfile, nginx config
- PWA manifest and offline fallback page
- Clean TypeScript (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes)
- Clean production build (`npm run build` passes, 13 routes)
- Dev server starts in ~280ms

---

## Phase 1: Struggles & Gotchas (Read This Before Continuing)

These are non-obvious issues that caused failures — future agents must be aware:

### 1. Prisma 7 is a major breaking change
Prisma 7 no longer accepts `url = env("DATABASE_URL")` in `schema.prisma`. The datasource block must only have `provider`. The connection URL now lives in `prisma.config.ts` (for migrations) and is passed to `PrismaClient` via a driver adapter (not as a constructor option).

**The correct pattern:**
```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@/app/generated/prisma/client";  // NOTE: /client not just /prisma
import { PrismaPg } from "@prisma/adapter-pg";

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL ?? "" });
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter });
```

**Required packages:** `@prisma/adapter-pg`, `pg`, `@types/pg`

**Import path:** The generated client is at `@/app/generated/prisma/client` (with `/client`) — NOT `@/app/generated/prisma`. There is no index.ts in the generated output.

### 2. Next.js 16 breaking changes
- **`middleware.ts` is deprecated.** Use `proxy.ts` instead. The file and export signature are identical — just rename.
- **Turbopack is default in `npm run build`.** Any package that adds a webpack config (like `@ducanh2912/next-pwa`) will cause a build error unless you add `turbopack: {}` to next.config.ts.
- **`experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages`** has moved to `serverExternalPackages` (top-level, not under experimental).

### 3. nodemailer version conflict
Auth.js (next-auth v5 beta.30) bundles `@auth/core@0.41.0` which requires `nodemailer@^6.8.0`. The `@auth/prisma-adapter` bundles `@auth/core@0.41.1` which requires `nodemailer@^7.0.7`. Installing `nodemailer@8` breaks everything.

**Pin to nodemailer@7:** `npm install nodemailer@7`

### 4. create-next-app won't scaffold into a directory named "Wardrobe"
npm package names cannot contain capital letters. The workaround is to scaffold into a temp subdirectory (`wardrobe-temp`) and then move the files up.

### 5. Node.js is not on the bash PATH in this environment
The bash shell used by Claude Code does not include Node.js by default on this machine. Every bash command that uses `node`, `npm`, or `npx` must be prefixed with:
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/nodejs" &&
```

---

---

## Phase 2: What Was Achieved

**Working:**
- Onboarding wizard at `/onboarding/photo` — client-side state machine (upload → result → manual → style)
- `POST /api/onboarding/analyze-photo` — uploads selfie to MinIO, sends to Claude Vision, returns season + reasoning JSON
- `POST /api/onboarding/complete` — upserts StyleProfile, sets `onboardingStatus = COMPLETE` in a transaction
- After completion: client calls `session.update()` to refresh JWT, proxy.ts then allows `/wardrobe`
- Manual fallback: deterministic season from 4 inputs via a lookup table (`SEASON_MAP` in manual-input-step.tsx)
- All 14 seasons reachable via the manual path
- Season override dropdown on the result screen
- Profile page at `/profile` — season card, archetype, palette swatches, skin/hair/eye details

**Key decisions:**
- Selfie preview uses a plain `<img>` tag (not `next/image`) — blob: URLs are not compatible with next/image's optimisation pipeline
- `analyze-photo` rejects HEIC files — Claude Vision doesn't support HEIC; browser camera capture auto-converts on iOS anyway
- Manual season mapping uses undertone + depth + hair (3 axes). Eyes collected but used only for display, not mapping — adding it as a 4th axis made the table too large without meaningful accuracy gain.

## Phase 2: Struggles & Gotchas

### 1. Auth.js Prisma adapter P2025 bug
`@auth/prisma-adapter`'s `useVerificationToken` uses `prisma.verificationToken.delete()` which throws `P2025` ("record not found") if the token was already consumed. Auth.js catches this as a `Verification` error and redirects to the error page (`/login`).

**Fix:** Override `useVerificationToken` on the adapter object in `lib/auth.ts` to catch `P2025` and return `null`.

### 2. Magic link callbackUrl not forwarded
The login page's `signIn()` call didn't pass `callbackUrl`, so the magic link always redirected to the default (`/`) instead of the page the user was on. After clicking the link, the user ended up back on `/login`.

**Fix:** Read `callbackUrl` from `useSearchParams()` in the login page and pass it to `signIn()`.

### 3. useSession requires SessionProvider
`useSession` from `next-auth/react` throws if used outside `<SessionProvider>`. The `(auth)` layout doesn't include one; only `(app)/layout.tsx` does.

**Fix:** Don't use `useSession` in the auth route group. Use `useSearchParams` for callbackUrl instead.

### 4. Next.js 16: params is a Promise in route handlers
Dynamic route params (`{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`) must be awaited. Same for `cookies()` and `headers()`. The `auth()` helper handles this internally.

### 5. session.update() does not reliably flush the JWT cookie before navigation
After completing onboarding, calling `await updateSession()` then navigating (even with `window.location.href`) races against the browser writing the new cookie. proxy.ts reads the old JWT and redirects the user back to `/onboarding`.

**Fix:** In `proxy.ts`, when the JWT says onboardingStatus is not COMPLETE and the user is accessing a protected route, fall back to a direct DB query (`prisma.user.findUnique`). This adds one DB call for the transition request only — all subsequent requests use the JWT directly. proxy.ts runs Node.js (not edge) so Prisma works there.

### 6. Anthropic API key tier requirement
`claude-sonnet-4-6` requires at least Tier 1 (paid) access. A freshly created API key on a free account will return `"credit balance too low"` even if credits show in the billing UI. You must upgrade to a paid tier AND generate a new API key after upgrading — existing keys do not automatically gain new tier permissions.
